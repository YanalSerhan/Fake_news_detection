Turkey just held a referendum that greatly expands the power of their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It passed by a very narrow margin, taking Turkey on its latest step toward brutal dictatorship, and here s Donald Trump, who sources say called Erdogan to congratulate him on  winning  the referendum vote.While we re busy justifying blowing up absolutely nothing in Syria because a brutal dictator used sarin gas on his people, Trump is busy calling someone who s working hard on becoming the region s next brutal dictator to congratulate him on furthering that goal.This referendum, according to The Daily Beast, moves Turkey away from a parliamentary democracy and towards one-person rule. But what he has already done there makes the referendum more of a formality. Erdogan had already managed to form a one-party government   a move that greatly diminishes the voices of opposition.Last year, Erdogan asked Turkey s parliament to redefine the country s anti-extremism law to include politicians, journalists and members of academia. He claimed that  pro-Kurdish  politicians were inciting terrorism, and journalists and academics were spreading the info that allowed the politicians to do so. Therefore, they are all terrorists.Branding press as  the enemy  is something Trump has been trying to do here. As the Washington Post s front page motto says,  Democracy dies in darkness.  This is the darkness.And now, Erdogan is, more or less, the sole ruler of Turkey.But what does Trump care? It wouldn t be surprising to find that he wishes something like that would happen here, too, if for no other reason than it would help cement his overinflated opinion of himself as a great man who is beloved by all, with nobody left to shine a light on the truth, like, oh, say, a free press.The way the Turkey referendum was held has appalled international election monitors. According to them,  voters were not provided with adequate information, opposition voices were muzzled and the rules were changed at the last minute.  In short, this was not a truly democratic process.Good job continuing to support authoritarian rulers over true democracies, Trump. You re about as un-American as it gets.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images\",\n          \"Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life. So he said those things under oath,  Karl began.  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events? One hundred percent,  Trump replied.  I didn t say under oath   I hardly know the man. I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other. If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury. And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him. Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience. But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey. In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him. If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility. He will say anything to save his own ass.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Monday Washington was  very concerned  by reports of violence around the Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk, which was seized by Baghdad s forces from Kurds.

Turkey just held a referendum that greatly expands the power of their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It passed by a very narrow margin, taking Turkey on its latest step toward brutal dictatorship, and here s Donald Trump, who sources say called Erdogan to congratulate him on  winning  the referendum vote.While we re busy justifying blowing up absolutely nothing in Syria because a brutal dictator used sarin gas on his people, Trump is busy calling someone who s working hard on becoming the region s next brutal dictator to congratulate him on furthering that goal.This referendum, according to The Daily Beast, moves Turkey away from a parliamentary democracy and towards one-person rule. But what he has already done there makes the referendum more of a formality. Erdogan had already managed to form a one-party government   a move that greatly diminishes the voices of opposition.Last year, Erdogan asked Turkey s parliament to redefine the country s anti-extremism law to include politicians, journalists and members of academia. He claimed that  pro-Kurdish  politicians were inciting terrorism, and journalists and academics were spreading the info that allowed the politicians to do so. Therefore, they are all terrorists.Branding press as  the enemy  is something Trump has been trying to do here. As the Washington Post s front page motto says,  Democracy dies in darkness.  This is the darkness.And now, Erdogan is, more or less, the sole ruler of Turkey.But what does Trump care? It wouldn t be surprising to find that he wishes something like that would happen here, too, if for no other reason than it would help cement his overinflated opinion of himself as a great man who is beloved by all, with nobody left to shine a light on the truth, like, oh, say, a free press.The way the Turkey referendum was held has appalled international election monitors. According to them,  voters were not provided with adequate information, opposition voices were muzzled and the rules were changed at the last minute.  In short, this was not a truly democratic process.Good job continuing to support authoritarian rulers over true democracies, Trump. You re about as un-American as it gets.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images\",\n          \"Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life. So he said those things under oath,  Karl began.  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events? One hundred percent,  Trump replied.  I didn t say under oath   I hardly know the man. I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other. If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury. And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him. Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience. But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey. In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him. If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility. He will say anything to save his own ass.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Monday Washington was  very concerned  by reports of violence around the Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk, which was seized by Baghdad s forces from Kurds.

freedom of information act foia lawsuit filed after the justice department failed to comply with a july   foia request seeking the following all fd  forms prepared pursuant to the federal bureau of investigation s investigation of former secretary of state hillary clinton s use of a private e mail server during her tenure all records of communications between any agent employee or representative of the federal bureau of investigation regarding concerning or related to the aforementioned investigation this request includes but is not limited to any related communications with any official employee or representative of the department of justice the executive office of the president the democratic national committee and or the presidential campaign of hillary clinton all records related to the meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton on june   the fbi originally informed judicial watch they did not locate any records related to the tarmac meeting however in a related case the justice department located emails in which justice department officials communicated with the fbi and wrote that they had communicated with the fbi as a result by letter dated august   from the fbi stated upon further review we subsequently determined potentially responsive documents may exist as a result your foia request has been reopened surprisingly the trump justice department refuses to disclose the talking points developed by the obama justice department to help it respond to press inquiries about the controversial june   tarmac meeting between loretta lynch and bill clinton at phoenix sky harbor international airport on june   attorney general loretta lynch met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the then ongoing investigation of mrs clinton s email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the u s department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting the fbi is out of control it is stunning that the fbi found these clinton lynch tarmac records only after we caught the agency hiding them in another lawsuit stated judicial watch tom fitton judicial watch will continue to press for answers about the fbi s document games in court in the meantime the fbi should stop the stonewall and release these new records immediately this case has also forced the fbi to release to the public the fbi s clinton investigative file although more than half of the records remain withheld the fbi has also told judicial watch that it anticipates completing the processing of these materials by july  there is significant controversy about whether the fbi and obama justice department investigation gave clinton and other witnesses and potential targets preferential treatment the obama administration extended numerous immunity agreements including clinton s former chief of staff cheryl mills john bentel former director of the state department s office of information resources management heather samuelson clinton s executive assistant brian pagliano an it employee at the state department who serviced the clinton non government server and an employee at platt river networks the company that maintained it it is not clear whether hillary clinton received some type of immunity in  a political action committee run by mcauliffe a close friend and political supporter of bill and hillary clinton donated nearly   to jill mccabe wife of mccabe who was then running for the virginia state senate also the virginia democratic party over which mcauliffe had significant

acknowledging that trump s victory had generated some uncertainty pena nieto reiterated his government would pursue dialogue with the next u s government to reach agreements we ll have to work with enormous pragmatism to agree what s useful and convenient for mexico and for the whole of north america he told a business summit in the central city of puebla mexican headquarters of german carmaker volkswagen vowgp de the mexican president added that his government was committed to providing macroeconomic stability for investors listing a flexible exchange rate central bank independence and a solid banking system among the key planks of his pledge concern has been widespread among business leaders and officials in mexico that trump could follow through on threats to abandon the north

white house has cited as a justification for the firing last week of fbi director james comey in closed door meetings with lawmakers on thursday and friday rosenstein said he wrote the memo after president donald trump told him one day before the may  firing that he wanted to dismiss comey he said that though he was personally fond of comey i thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader the justice department on friday issued a transcript of rosenstein s remarks opening statement good afternoon i welcome the opportunity to discuss my role in the removal of fbi director james comey although i know you understand that i will not discuss the special counsel s ongoing investigation most importantly i want to emphasize my unshakeable commitment to protecting the integrity of every federal criminal investigation there never has been and never will be any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the united states department of justice before i discuss the events of the past two weeks i want to provide some background about my previous relationship with former director comey i have known jim comey since approximately  in  when mr comey was deputy attorney general he participated in selecting me to serve as a u s attorney as a federal prosecutor he was a role model his speeches about leadership and public service inspired me on july   director comey held his press conference concerning the federal grand jury investigation of secretary clinton s emails at the start of the press conference the director stated that he had not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the department of justice they do not know what i am about to say director comey went on to declare that he would publicly disclose what we did what we found and what we are recommending to the department of justice he proceeded to disclose details about the evidence assert that the american people deserve to know details declare that no reasonable prosecutor would file charges and criticize secretary clinton i thought the july  press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the department of justice and secretary clinton it explicitly usurped the role of the attorney general the deputy attorney general and the entire department of justice it violated deeply engrained rules and traditions and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the fbi of interfering in the election there are lawful and appropriate mechanisms to deal with unusual circumstances in which public confidence in the rule of law may be jeopardized such mechanisms preserve the traditional balance of power between investigators and prosecutors and protect the rights of citizens director comey attended the maryland u s attorney s office training seminar on october   and gave a detailed explanation of his reasons for making public statements about the conclusion of the secretary clinton email investigation i strongly disagreed with his analysis but i believe that he made his decisions in good faith the next day october  mr comey sent his letter to the congress announcing that the fbi was reopening the clinton email investigation he subsequently has said that he believed he was obligated to send the letter i completely disagree he again usurped the authority of the department of justice by sending the letter over the objection of the department of justice flouted rules and deeply engrained traditions and guaranteed that some people would accuse the fbi of interfering in the election before the senate judiciary committee on may   director comey testified under oath about his public statements concerning the secretary clinton email investigation i strongly disagreed with his explanations particularly his assertion that maintaining confidentiality about criminal investigations constitutes concealment nonetheless i respected him personally former department of justice officials from both political parties have criticized director comey s decisions it was not just an isolated mistake the series of public statements about the email investigation in my opinion departed from the proper role of the fbi director and damaged public confidence in the bureau and the department in one of my first meetings with then senator jeff sessions last winter we discussed the need for new leadership at the fbi among the concerns that i recall were to restore the credibility of the fbi respect the established authority of the department of justice limit public statements and eliminate leaks on may  i learned that president trump intended to remove director comey and sought my advice and input notwithstanding my personal affection for director comey i thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader i wrote a brief memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my longstanding concerns about director comey s public statements concerning the secretary clinton email investigation i chose the issues to include in my memorandum before finalizing the memorandum on may  i asked a senior career attorney on my staff to review it that attorney is an ethics expert who has worked in the office of the deputy attorney general during multiple administrations he was familiar with the issues i informed the senior attorney that the president was going to remove director comey that i was writing a memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my own concerns and that i wanted to confirm that everything in my memorandum was accurate he concurred with the points raised in my memorandum i also asked several other career department attorneys to review the memorandum and provide edits my memorandum is not a legal brief these are not issues of law my memorandum is not a finding of official misconduct the inspector general will render his judgment about that issue in due course my memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for cause termination my memorandum is not a survey of fbi morale or performance my memorandum is not a press release it is a candid internal memorandum about the fbi director s public statements concerning a high profile criminal investigation i sent my signed memorandum to the attorney general after noon on tuesday may  i wrote it i believe it i stand by it finally i want to address the media claims that the fbi asked for additional resources for the investigation of russian interference in the  presidential election i am not aware of any such request moreover i consulted my staff and acting fbi director andrew mccabe and none of them recalls such a request end of transcriptthe white house has struggled since comey s firing to explain the chain of events that led to it and who exactly made the decision trump said as recently as thursday that he acted on a very strong recommendation from rosenstein but rosenstein made it clear to congress that he drafted his memo only after trump told him of his plans to dismiss the fbi director he said he did not intend for the document to be a finding of misconduct or a statement of reasons to justify the firing but he added i wrote it i believe it i stand by it via nbc chicago\"\n        ],\n
